        <!-- Your code goes here -->		<div class="p2">Then explain where you stand now, the   skills that   you still   lack and hope to acquire by an   MBA? How an MBA will fill the gaps in your career and bring you closer to the fulfillment of your goals?           Then discuss your short term and long term goals.  Be clear and quite decisive for short term goals (even if you are not 100% sure.) Show that you have put some thought into it. For long term goals,  		   		   connection between short term and long term goals. Explain how you foresee yourself progressing from short term to long term goals (A to B to C). Show sincerity and passion in talking about your dreams.           Once you have explained your career aspirations and your need for an MBA, explain how an evening MBA from Booth is your best bet at this time and   how it will help you achieve your goals. All schools 		   		   expect you to not only have a clear sense of your goals but also of their connection to their offerings. A thorough knowledge of the school’s curriculum, faculty, and special programs will enable you to 		   explain how they are aligned to your goals. Again, do not forget to answer why you are interested in the evening program instead of full time program. The school wants to know the reason why you want to 		   		   pursue higher education while continuing with your employment.In the end, discuss what value you will bring to their program? In order to demonstrate your ‘fit’ with the program, you also need to explain		   in what ways you will contribute to the program.From__ <br>		   <a href="http://myessayreview.com/blogs/?cat=7"> MY PARAGRAPH</a>		   </div>
